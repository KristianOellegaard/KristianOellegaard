## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Kristian Ã˜llegaard, Python Developer and founder of [Fenerum](https://www.fenerum.com) and [Plecto](https://www.plecto.com).

I'm particularly interested in Django which I have been using for everything since I got to know it around 2005/v0.95.

You can read more about what I'm up to on my [personal website](https://www.kristian.io)
